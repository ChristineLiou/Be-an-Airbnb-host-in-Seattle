If you are considering being a host in Seattle, you must know about the market. What kinds of property provided in Seattle? How to get more review scores? How to price your place?

According to the data from Airbnb in 2016 to 2017, we can find the insight from the data and know more about the trend of traveler preference in Seattle.

2. What is the most type of property provided in Seattle? And Which property has topped review score?
3. Howâ€™s the correlation with the accommodation, review scores, and price?
4. What reason might affect the review score from the customers?

A linear regression model is also estiblished to predict the review scores from the guests.
